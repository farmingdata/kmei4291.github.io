			<h3><font color=#000000>What's the Issue?</font></h3>
			<p><font color=#000000>Over 60% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa work in agriculture. Many are smallholder farmers, producing 80% of the domestic food supply. Their earnings from agriculture are a primary source of household income. For example, in Tanzania, 56% of a smallholder's household income comes from farming.</font></p>
			<p><font color=#000000>However, market inefficiency is often an issue. Smallholder farmers face difficulties in selling for better prices and in organising transport logistics.</font></p>
			<p><font color=#000000>Given the majority of low- and lower-middle income families in smallholder agriculture, we believe there's a huge opportunity for innovative digital platforms likes ours to streamline market transactions for both sellers and buyers.</font></p>
